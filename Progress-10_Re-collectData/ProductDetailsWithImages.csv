TetrahexyldecylAscorbate: a stable, oil-soluble form of vitamin C that penetrates lipid layers of skin, neutralizes free radicals and helps prevent hyperpigmentation. Ascorbic Acid: naturally derived from fruits & vegetables, ascorbic acid is Vitamin C in its purest form. This potent antioxidant protects and repairs skin cells and up regulates collagen gene expression through increasing the degradation of lipids, ultimately resulting in firming skin. Lactic Acid: gently loosens the bonds between epidermal cells to exfoliate skin’s surface. It also naturally hydrates, reducing trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) through the stimulation of ceramides and GAGS in skin. Lactic Acid can also serve as a powerful delivery vehicle forother ingredients, as it increases their penetration into the skin, and their efficacy. Tranexamic Acid: derived from the amino acid Lysine, Tranexamic Acid interacts with pigmentation enzymes plasmin and plasminogen, which often appear in dark spots caused by UVA/UVB damage. This interaction, driven by Tranexamic Acid, blocks a linkage between Keratinocytes and Melanocytes, therefore reducing the appearance of dark spots, preventing new ones from forming, and improving overall skin tone. Additionally, Tranexamic Acid has been shown to perform very well when combined with powerhouse pigmentation-reducer, Vitamin C. Centella Asiatica: also nicknamed gotukola or tiger grass, this medicinal herb is widely used in traditional Asian medicine as well as Ayurvedic medicine, for the treatment of skin diseases and for wound healing. This extract has antioxidant properties and helps protects skin’s moisture barrier.

Gently exfoliates, reduces the appearance of pores and minimises future breakouts.

Unlike Alpha and Beta Hydroxy Acids, L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and Retinoids, it is non-acidic and non-irritating.

Suitable for all skin types.","Dr. Barbara Sturm announces the launch of the newest addition to the high performance SUPER ANTI-AGING COLLECTION, and the companion to the bestselling NIGHT SERUM, the SUPER ANTI-AGING NIGHT CREAM. Whilst we’re sleeping, the skin moves from protect to repair mode: essential hormones such as Melatonin and HGH start to rise and accelerate skin's repair and cell regeneration, helping the body to detoxify from excess metabolic and oxidative damage and to fight off free radicals, whilst preventing further damage (such as wrinkles, lines and hyperpigmentation) from occurring. As we age and cellular skin functions slow down; detoxification (our skin's ability to repair the effects of oxidative stress), becomes less effective, cell renewal decreases and the skin produces fewer natural oils, whilst free radicals and oxidized protein waste accumulate, preventing the skin from effective repair and regeneration. Dr. Sturm's SUPER ANTI-AGING NIGHT CREAM optimizes the skin’s detox processes with a special peptide from the Avocado, which helps eliminate oxidized protein and helps the body regenerate proteins, lipids, and cells that have been damaged during the day due to free radical oxidation. It also contains an exclusive DBS Night System™ - a three-fold, advanced science system which fully supports the skin’s nocturnal renewal processes and leaves cells completely hydrated so that they’re able to function effectively and focus their energy on repair and rejuvenation.",https://contenthub-delivery.mecca.com/api/public/content/I-058157-I-058157-M1-DrBarbaraSturm-SuperAntiAgingNightCream-ttWUD4NX8kKs6YTHRIBBw.webp?t=blur,https://www.mecca.com/en-au/dr-barbara-sturm/super-anti-aging-night-cream-I-058157/?cgpath=skincare
