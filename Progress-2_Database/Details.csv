This collagen book-ending effect plumps and firms the skin, reducing fine lines and wrinkles. Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate – an innovative form of hyaluronic acid that penetrates deeper into the skin, resists degradation, and lasts up to 13 times longer than traditional hyaluronic acids for advanced hydration.

TetrahexyldecylAscorbate: a stable, oil-soluble form of vitamin C that penetrates lipid layers of skin, neutralizes free radicals and helps prevent hyperpigmentation. Ascorbic Acid: naturally derived from fruits & vegetables, ascorbic acid is Vitamin C in its purest form. This potent antioxidant protects and repairs skin cells and up regulates collagen gene expression through increasing the degradation of lipids, ultimately resulting in firming skin. Lactic Acid: gently loosens the bonds between epidermal cells to exfoliate skin’s surface. It also naturally hydrates, reducing trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) through the stimulation of ceramides and GAGS in skin. Lactic Acid can also serve as a powerful delivery vehicle forother ingredients, as it increases their penetration into the skin, and their efficacy. Tranexamic Acid: derived from the amino acid Lysine, Tranexamic Acid interacts with pigmentation enzymes plasmin and plasminogen, which often appear in dark spots caused by UVA/UVB damage. This interaction, driven by Tranexamic Acid, blocks a linkage between Keratinocytes and Melanocytes, therefore reducing the appearance of dark spots, preventing new ones from forming, and improving overall skin tone. Additionally, Tranexamic Acid has been shown to perform very well when combined with powerhouse pigmentation-reducer, Vitamin C. Centella Asiatica: also nicknamed gotukola or tiger grass, this medicinal herb is widely used in traditional Asian medicine as well as Ayurvedic medicine, for the treatment of skin diseases and for wound healing. This extract has antioxidant properties and helps protects skin’s moisture barrier. Ceramides: found within cell membranes, this skin-identical lipid helps hold together the cells of the stratum corneum with a multi-layeredbarrier that locks in maximum hydration and effectively reduces TEWL.","Parabens, phthalates and sulfates.",For AM/PM use.
